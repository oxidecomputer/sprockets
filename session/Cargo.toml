# x25519-dalek requires 0.5.1. 0.6.X versions are incompatible.
# There is an outstanding PR for this, but no response from the maintainer.
# There is also a 2.0.0 pre-release that hasn't been touched in 7 months.
# Interestingly salty uses the dalek agreement basically
#
# The ring API requires a KDF and is a bit more awkward to use.
